# Modelling of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ FatA in complex with its native ligand

Modelling of _A. thaliana_ FatA dimer in complex with its native ligands.
The acyl carrier protein, ACP, has a serine O-conjugated
to a phosphopantetheine, (chemical component accession: `PNS`),
which is in turn conjugated to oleic acid (`OLA`).

The most crucial state for analyses is arguably the transition state, which is the hemiacetal.
This was modelled at first especially as that is what `PDB:1R3` mimics.

The approach taken was to use PDB:1R3, alter it and energy minimise it.

* [substrate.pdb](fatA-substrate.pdb) is the substrate bound holoenzyme.
* [transition.pdb](fatA-transition.pdb) is the transition state.
